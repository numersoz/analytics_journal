    "### Data Source Name: Solar Power Generation Data\n",
    "### Source URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few areas of concern at the solar power plant -\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management\n",
    "Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?\n",
    "Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?\n",
    "\"\n",

    "### Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "DATE_TIME: Date and time for each observation. Observations recorded at 15 minute intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "PLANT_ID: Plant ID - this will be common for the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOURCE_KEY: Source key in this file stands for the inverter id.\n",
    "\n",
    "DC_POWER: Amount of DC power generated by the inverter (source_key) in this 15 minute interval. Units - kW.\n",
    "\n",
    "AC_POWER: Amount of AC power generated by the inverter (source_key) in this 15 minute interval. Units - kW.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAILY_YIELD: Daily yield is a cumulative sum of power generated on that day, till that point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "TOTAL_YIELD: This is the total yield for the inverter till that point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE: This is the ambient temperature at the plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "MODULE_TEMPERATURE:There's a module (solar panel) attached to the sensor panel. This is the temperature reading for that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "IRRADIATION: Amount of irradiation for the 15 minute interval."
