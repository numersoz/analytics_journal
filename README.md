# Data Science Journal

Collection of different topics in Data Science and their implementation examples.

## Virtual Environment

Dependencies are listed here: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

On Windows, they can be installed with below commands:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Package versions were not specified in requirements.txt to allow pip to resolve conflicts. This may break some of the code's reproducibility in the future.

## [Tree Based Models](tree_based_models)

Collection of regression/classification problems using tree based models such as:

* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* ADA Boost
* Gradient Boost
* Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost)
